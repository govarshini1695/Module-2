# Exp. No: 2a  
## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING 1 TO N EVEN NUMBERS

###  Aim
To create a Python program for printing `1 to n`  even numbers using a `for` loop.

---

###  Algorithm

1. Begin the program.
2. Use `input()` to read the value of `1 to n` (the upper limit) from the user.
3. Convert the input to an integer.
4. Display the message **"Even Numbers are :"**.
5. Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
6. In each iteration, print the current value of `i`.
7. Terminate the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
#Reg.NO 212223020009
#Name Govarshini.P
#Write your Code here
Even = int(input(""))
total = 0
for number in range(1,Even+1):
    if(number % 2 == 0):
        print(number)
        
```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
```
Thus the Python program for printing `1 to n`  even numbers using a `for` loop is executed.
